career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I am a software engineer focused on backend and platform (runtime & delivery).
    I design and ship Spring Boot services in Kotlin/Java and operate them reliably on Kubernetes (AKS/EKS)
    with production-grade CI/CD and observability. I care about measurable outcomes—latency, error rate,
    and release lead time—and collaborate across code, pipelines, and runtime to improve both delivery speed
    and resilience.
